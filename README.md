# BirthRate-Analysis

Birth Rate Analysis in South Korea

Project Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing birth rates across cities and districts in South Korea. Using various statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Clustering, the study identifies key patterns and regional differences.


Key Objectives
Identify major factors influencing birth rates.
Classify regions based on demographic and urban characteristics.
Provide actionable insights for policymaking.


Features
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Extracts key factors such as Urban Development, Demographic Factors, and Households with Children.
Factor Analysis: Groups influencing birth rates into categories like Parents of Young Children and Urban Fiscal Capacity.
Clustering: Classifies regions into distinct groups based on their characteristics.
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS): Visualizes proximity between regions based on birth rate-related factors.


Key Findings
Urban Development (fiscal independence) and Demographic Factors (population growth) are major components influencing birth rates.
Clustering revealed two main groups: Metropolitan + Provincial Cities and Non-Metropolitan Areas.
Regional policies should focus on increasing the population of marriageable-age women and enhancing fiscal resources.
